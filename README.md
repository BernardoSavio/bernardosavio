## Hi there 👋

My name is Bernardo, and I'm a I.T. Technician deeply interested in compared languages (be they human or programming ones) and Software Development.

- 🔭 I’m recently studying human and programming languages family trees looking for similarities that might help me to learn the maximum amount of languages of interest I possibly can.
- 🤝 I'm also currently looking for opportunities of entry-level development jobs. 
- 📫 Feel free to send me an e-mail at bernardosmdfernandez@gmail.com
